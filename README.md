My aunt Sonia recipes

I'm starting this webpage as part of the Odin Project recipe website. The idea is to create a basic html based webpage 
to apply the learned concepts about it in which I put some recipe so I decided to tweak the idea a bit and focus on my
aunts recipes. 

I'll be revisiting the code in the future to implement new changes when I lear CSS and Javascript and I hope to have a
beautiful and modern webpage and share it with my family.
