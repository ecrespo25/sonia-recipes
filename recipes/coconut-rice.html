    <p>Another very popular dish in the Colombian's Coast Gastronomy.</p>
    <ul><h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <li>3 cups Rice</li>
        <li>500 ml Coconut milk</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons Sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
        <li>Raisins to taste</li>
        <li>Water as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <ol><h3>Steps</h3>
        <li>Measure out 1 cup (approximately 250ml) of pure coconut milk and set it aside. Mix the remaining 250ml of coconut milk 
            with enough water to make 6 cups (approximately 1.5 liters) of coconut milk mixture.</li>
        <li>In a deep pot, combine the 1 cup of pure coconut milk, sugar, and salt. Heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring constantly, 
            until it thickens and starts to separate into oil and a brown, coconut-flake-like mixture (titote).</li>
        <li>Continue stirring the titote until it turns a deep brown color. Be careful not to burn the mixture.</li>
        <li>Immediately pour in the 6 cups of coconut milk mixture and bring to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Add the 3 cups of rice and stir constantly until bubbles start to form on the surface.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low and cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid. Cook for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add raisins to taste, stir gently, and continue cooking for another 5 minutes with the lid on.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat and let the rice rest for a minute or two before serving. Your coconut rice with raisins is now ready!</li>
    </ol>
