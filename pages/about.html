    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>I'm starting this webpage as part of the Odin Project recipe website. The idea is to create a basic html based webpage 
       to apply the learned concepts about it in which I put some recipe so I decided to tweak the idea a bit and focus on my
       aunts recipes.</p> 

    <p>I'll be revisiting the code in the future to implement new changes when I lear CSS and Javascript and I hope to have a
       beautiful and modern webpage and share it with my family.</p>
